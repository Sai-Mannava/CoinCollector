Objective: Create a game where players can control a character and collect coins by touching them.

Steps:

Setting up the Environment

Create a new Roblox game project or use an existing one.
Open the game in Roblox Studio.
Insert a part to act as the ground. This will serve as the surface where coins will appear.
Insert a humanoid character for the player to control. You can use the StarterPack folder to insert a Player character.
Creating Coins

Insert a part to represent the coin.
Resize and design the coin part as you like (e.g., make it look like a coin).
Rename the coin part to "Coin."
Scripting the Coin Behavior

Insert a new Script into the "Coin" part.
Use the following Lua script to make the coin disappear when a player touches it and increase their score:

Setting Up Player Points
Insert a Folder into the StarterPack and name it "leaderstats."
Inside "leaderstats," insert an IntValue and name it "Points." This will keep track of the player's score.
Testing the Game

Click the "Play" button in Roblox Studio to test your game.
Move the player character around using the arrow keys or WASD controls.
When the character touches the coin, their score should increase, and the coin should disappear.
Enhancements (Optional)

Add more coins with different values.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the player's score.
Add a time limit or other challenges to make the game more engaging.
